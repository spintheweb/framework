## What is a Webbase?

A Webbase is a declarative model in WBDL that couples systems with user experience. It maps data sources (databases, APIs, services) to UI content (forms, tables, text, menus, trees, calendars, etc.) and behaviors to render portals with a consistent UX.

A Webbaselet is a standalone module that extends a Webbase with specific functionalityâ€”for example, a web mail client (POP3/SMTP), an ERP client, or a BPMS client. Each integrates with its backend while presenting a uniform UX within the portal. Shared navitation 

The Webspinner runtime loads a Webbase and wires data sources to content, delivering consistent user experiences across diverse backends.
