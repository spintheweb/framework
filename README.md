## What is a Webbase?
A Webbase is a WBDL declarative model that defines a portal’s structure, navigation, layout, components, data bindings, and behaviors. It maps data sources (databases, APIs, services) to UI elements (forms, tables, text, menus, trees, calendars, etc.), enabling the runtime to render a consistent user experience across heterogeneous backends. Webbases can be extended modularly with Webbaselets.

A Webbaselet is a standalone module that extends a Webbase with specific functionality—for example, a web mail client (POP3/SMTP), an ERP client, or a BPMS client. Each integrates with its backend while presenting a uniform UX within the portal.
